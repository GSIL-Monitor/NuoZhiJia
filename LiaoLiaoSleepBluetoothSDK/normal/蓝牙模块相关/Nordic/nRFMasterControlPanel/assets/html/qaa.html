	<h1>Answers:</h1>
	<li>
		<h2 id="qg1">What does the application do?</h2>
		The nRF Master Control Panel is an application that lets you scan, discover, and debug your Bluetooth Smart devices.
		It displays the list of advertising BLE devices and allows you to connect to them, and read and write data. You must have 
		a Bluetooth 4.0+ device in order to make use of the application.
	</li>
	<li>
		<h2 id="qg2">How it uses the required permissions?</h2>
		The application currently requires the following permissions:
		<ul>
			<li>modify or delete content of your USB storage</li>
			When you launch the nRF Master Control Panel application for the first time it copies some scripts and sample apps to 
			the 'Nordic Semiconductor' folder on your external storage (f.e. SD card).<br />
			The application lets you save the advertising data, RSSI values or the log session into the file.
			<li>access Bluetooth settings, pair with Bluetooth devices</li>
			Application scans for Bluetooth Smart devices, lets you connect to them, send and receive data, and bond.
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h2 id="qg3">Is the application free?</h2>
		Yes. The application is available on Google Play free of charge.
	</li>
	<li>
		<h2 id="qg4">Is the source code available?</h2>
		No, the source code is not available. If you would like to suggest some change, report a bug or make a feature request please
		contact us using the "Send feedback" button in the menu.
		If you are interested in a sample code, we've released the source code of our other applications (f.e. nRF Toolbox) for Android 
		and iOS on our web-site for our customers.
		Please, go to <a href="http://www.nordicsemi.com/eng/Products/nRFready-Demo-APPS">www.nordicsemi.no</a> for more information.
	</li>
	<li>
		<h2 id="qal1">Why can't I see my device on the list?</h2>
		The nRF Master Control Panel application scans for all Bluetooth Smart devices in the range. Your device may not be visible on the list 
		if at least one of the following statements is true:
		<ul>
		<li>the device does not support Bluetooth 4.0+</li>
		<li>the device is already connected to another device</li>
		<li>the device is bonded to another device</li>
		<li>Bluetooth adapter is disabled or not available on the phone/tablet</li>
		<li>the Bluetooth error occurred on the Android system</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h2 id="qal2">How can I see the advertising data of the device?</h2>
		Click on the device row to expand it and see the advertising data in an accessible form. Click on the RAW button to see the unformatted raw data.
	</li>
	<li>
		<h2 id="qal3">Why some rows in the device details have an arrow on the left side?</h2>
		Some data in the advertising packet may have more than one meaning. nRF MCP gives you an option to change the parser assigned to this value by
		showing the small arrow icon on the left. List of available parsers varies and depends on the value length and format.
	</li>
	<li>
		<h2 id="qal4">Can I clear the list of devices?</h2>
		Yes. Please stop the scanner, open the menu and click on the Refresh menu item.
	</li>
	<li>
		<h2 id="qal5">Can I filter the list of devices?</h2>
		The only option to filter some devices is to mark them as favourite. Please, press the icon next to its name to add it to favourites. Than
		you may select the "Only favourites" option in the menu to hide devices that are not on your list.
	</li>
	<li>
		<h2 id="qal5">What is the RSSI?</h2>
		The RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indication) is a measurement of the power present in a received radio signal. It's usually displayed
		in dBm (Decibel-milliwatts). Low power devices, like Bluetooth Smart devices, are using very week power to transfer data, therefore the usual values 
		of RSSI are between -100dBm	(very week signal) to around -20 dBm (strong signal).
	</li>
	<li>
		<h2 id="qal6">Why the RSSI values are different on two Android devices?</h2>
		By definition the RSSI value is a measurement of the power present in received radio signal. The signal strength depends on the antennas,
		device orientation, location, distance from the phone to the target device, humidity etc.
	</li>
	<li>
		<h2 id="qal7">Why the RSSI graph ends few seconds after it has been found?</h2>
		On some phones (f.e. Nexus 4 and Nexus 7) the application is being notified only about the first advertising packet received during one 
		scanning. This value is being shown on the graph. After few seconds, when no more packets are received, the graph ends for this device.
		You may disable continuous scanning in Settings-&gt;Scanner. When disabled the application will scan in 1 second periods which will 
		keep the graph going. This option should be enabled if your phone/tablet does not have this issue.
	</li>
	<li>
		<h2 id="qal8">Can I copy the advertising data to another application?</h2>
		Yes. Long-press the row you want to copy to go to selection mode. You may select more device while in selection mode by pressing other rows.
		Click COPY or SHARE icon to copy the devices' data to your application or select the SAVE option to save it in a file. You may also 
		export the advertising data to the nRF Logger application.
	</li>
	<li>
		<h2 id="qal9">Can I export the graph to EXCEL or CSV format?</h2>
		Yes. Please, long-press the row you want to copy to go to selection mode. 
		You may select more device while in selection mode by pressing other rows. Press on the SAVE menu and select desired format.
	</li>
	<li>
		<h2 id="qa10">How can I connect to a device without CONNECT button?</h2>
		By default application allows to connect only to bonded devices or those with GENERAL DISCOVERABLE or LIMITED DISCOVERABLE flag set. 
		If you want to connect to other device, please go to Settings-&gt;Connectivity and change the switch to ALL.
	</li>
	<li>
		<h2 id="qa11">What does autoConnect mean?</h2>
		When connected with autoConnect the Android will try to establish connection whenever the device is in range. Please, refer to 
		<a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/bluetooth/BluetoothDevice.html#connectGatt%28android.content.Context,%20boolean,%20android.bluetooth.BluetoothGattCallback%29">Android documentation</a>
		for more information.
	</li>
	<li>
		<h2 id="qa12">How can I bond to the device?</h2>
		You may bond to a device in 3 ways: 
		<ul>
		<li>Press the small white arrow on the CONNECT button to show the connection options. Click the Bond item.</li>
		<li>Connect to the device by pressing CONNECT button and wait until the device connects. Click the Bond item in the menu.</li>
		<li>Go to Android settings-&gt;Bluetooth and click on the device you want to bond.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h2 id="qa13">Can I connect to more than one device at once?</h2>
		Ensure that all devices that you want to connect are visible on the list and have the CONNECT button visible. Check the "Connectivity"
		and "Only favourites" options if necessary. Connect to one of devices. On the new screen press the navigation menu at the top to see more 
		available devices. Click on the row with a device you want to connect to. You may also set the autoConnect option by pressing the 
		blue settings icon.
	</li>
	<li>
		<h2 id="qa14">Can I save or export the log?</h2>
		Yes. If you have the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=no.nordicsemi.android.log">nRF Logger</a> application 
		installed on your phone/tablet the log session may be saved automatically. See Settings-&gt;Logger for more options. If you are not interested
		in this application you may always save the log to a file, copy it or share it using the menu below be log.
	</li>
	<li>
		<h2 id="qa15">How can I enable all notifications at once?</h2>
		When connected open the menu and select Bulk operations-&gt;Enable services. You may also read all characteristics at once. Those operations may take some time 
		depending on the interval connection of the device and number of characteristics.
	</li>
	<li>
		<h2 id="qa16">How can I write any bytes to a characteristic with custom writer?</h2>
		nRF Master Control Panel has build in parsers and writers for number of characteristics. If you want to disable this feature and use the default dialog uncheck the 
		"Parse known characteristics" option in the menu.
	</li>
	<li>
		<h2 id="qao1">What is the DFU?</h2>
		DFU (Device Firmware Update) is a protocol used to transfer an updated version of the application, SoftDevice or a Bootloader on a nRF51822 chip
		Over-the-Air. Please, see the documentation for more details: <a href="https://devzone.nordicsemi.com/documentation/nrf51/6.1.0/s110/html/a00056.html">link</a>.
