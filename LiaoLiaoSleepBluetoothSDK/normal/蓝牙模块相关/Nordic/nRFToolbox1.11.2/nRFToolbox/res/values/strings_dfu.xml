        in Android API is being invoked when the data has been written to the outgoing queue, not when physically sent. Packet Receipt Notifications were introduced to prevent from 
        overflowing the queue. Disabling them or setting the value to high (> ~300) may cause the DFU process to freeze at some point, depending on the device model.</string>

        a file from the Internet you may use f.e. Drive or Dropbox application.
        \n\nYou will be asked to select an application if more than one is installed. A single application will be launched automatically.

        \nYou may also provide the Init packet(s) that will be send to verify the firmware on the device side. More information about the Init packet is in the DFU documentation.</string>
    <string name="dfu_about_text">The Device Firmware Update (DFU) app allows users to update the firmware of their Bluetooth Smart device over-the-air (OTA). It is compatible with
